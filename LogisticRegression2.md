# 🔍 Logistic Regression Deep Dive — From Sigmoid to Accuracy  
> **“When probabilities meet decisions, math gets strategic.”** 😅📊

This page unpacks the mechanics behind logistic regression — from sigmoid curves to classification thresholds, logit functions, and evaluation metrics.

<summary>📐 Sigmoid Function — The Probability Gate</summary>

### 🎯 What It Does  
Transforms any real-valued number into a probability between 0 and 1.



\[
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \quad \text{where } z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_n x_n
\]



### ☕ Analogy  
Think of it as Kanak’s chai meter — low stress = low probability of needing chai, high stress = high probability.

<summary>🔢 Probabilities, Classes & Thresholds</summary>

### 🧠 How It Works  
Logistic regression outputs a probability \( \hat{p} \) for class membership.  
We convert this into a class label using a **threshold** (default = 0.5):

- If \( \hat{p} > \text{threshold} \) → Class 1 (e.g., “Stressed”)  
- If \( \hat{p} < \text{threshold} \) → Class 0 (e.g., “Calm”)

### ⚖️ Implications of Changing the Threshold  
| Threshold ↑ | Threshold ↓ |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fewer positives predicted | More positives predicted |
| Higher precision | Higher recall |
| May miss true positives | May include false positives |

<summary>📈 Decision Boundary</summary>

### 🎯 What It Is  
The point where the predicted probability crosses the threshold — typically where \( \hat{p} = 0.5 \).  
In 2D, it’s a line; in higher dimensions, it’s a hyperplane.

### ☕ Analogy  
It’s like Kanak’s debugging threshold — below 0.5, it’s “probably fine”; above 0.5, it’s “time to refactor.”

<summary>📊 Logit Function — Why It Matters</summary>

### 🧠 Definition  
The **logit** is the inverse of the sigmoid:



\[
\text{logit}(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right)
\]



### 🎯 Why Use It  
- Converts probabilities to **log-odds**  
- Makes the model **linear in parameters**  
- Enables interpretation of coefficients

<details>
<summary>🎲 Odds — The Intuition</summary>

### 🧠 What Are Odds?  
Odds represent the ratio of success to failure:



\[
\text{Odds} = \frac{p}{1 - p}
\]



### 📊 Example  
- \( p = 0.8 \) → Odds = 4 (4 times more likely to be class 1)  
- \( p = 0.2 \) → Odds = 0.25 (less likely to be class 1)

<summary>🚦 Classifications & Misclassifications</summary>

### ✅ True Positives (TP)  
Correctly predicted class 1

### ❌ False Positives (FP)  
Predicted class 1, but it’s actually class 0

### ❌ False Negatives (FN)  
Predicted class 0, but it’s actually class 1

### ✅ True Negatives (TN)  
Correctly predicted class 0

</details>

<details>
<summary>📏 Classification Accuracy</summary>

### 🧮 Formula  


\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\]



### ⚠️ Caveat  
Accuracy can be misleading with **imbalanced classes** — use **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score** for deeper insight.

<details>
<summary>🎯 Class of Interest</summary>

### 🧠 What It Means  
The class you care most about — often the **positive class** (e.g., “Stressed”, “Churn”, “Disease”).

### 📊 Why It Matters  
- Guides threshold tuning  
- Impacts metric selection  
- Shapes model interpretation

- ✂️ Tune thresholds for precision vs recall trade-offs  
- 🧠 Extend to **multiclass and multilabel** setups
